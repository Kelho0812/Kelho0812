Seasoned professional transitioning from leadership roles in Marketing and Customer Support to a career in software development. 

Nearing the completion of an intensive programming course with hands-on experience in C and C++, as well as a solid understanding of core computer science principles such as system programming, process management, and memory handling. 

I'm adept at problem-solving and project management, with a proven track record of leading teams and optimizing processes, and I'm eager to leverage  both my people skills and my recently acquired technical expertise to help innovative software development projects.
